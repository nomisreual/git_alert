This is a Python application that checks in the given directory and all its subdirectories
for any dirty repositories.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nomisreual/git_alert).

This application aims to ease the frequent use of git as it makes it easy to check for any untracked changes in any of your repositories.

## Installation:

The application is now available on PyPI, so you can install it using pip:

```
pip install git_alert
```

Alternatively, you can use pipx to make it globally available:

```
pipx install git_alert
```

Of course you can also clone the repository and install it manually. The package is built using poetry, so the easiest way to build it locally would be
to use poetry:

```
git clone https://github.com/nomisreual/git_alert.git
cd git_alert
poetry build
```

After the build, you can install it either using pip or pipx:

```
pip install -e .
```

or

```
pipx install .
```

## Usage:

You can use _git_alert_ by either calling it as a module (`python -m git_alert`) or by directly using the installed package:

```
usage: git_alert [-h] [--path PATH] [--only_dirty]

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  --path PATH   top level directory to start the search in
  --only_dirty  only show dirty repositories in the final report
```

## Development:

The tool is aimed to be improved and extended going forward. If you have any ideas or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Goals:

- [ ] more detailed checks (currently it distinguishes only between a repository being clean or not)
- [ ] speed up the lookup process
- [ ] enable caching found repositories for faster checking after the first run (maybe utilizing a database)
- [ ] GUI interface

## Contributing:

This project is under active development, so any contributions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

In case you want to submit a pull request, please:

- make sure to run the tests before submission
- use black for code formatting

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality, so feel free to use them as well.
