This is a Python application that checks in the given directory and all its subdirectories
for any dirty repositories.

This application aims to ease the frequent use of git as it makes it easy to check for any untracked changes in any of your repositories.

## Installation:

The application is now available on **PyPI**, so you can install it using _pip_:

```
pip install git_alert
```

Alternatively, you can use _pipx_ to make it globally available:

```
pipx install git_alert
```

Of course you can also clone the repository and install it manually. The package is built using poetry, so the easiest way to build it locally would be
to use poetry:

```
git clone https://github.com/nomisreual/git_alert.git
cd git_alert
poetry build
```

After the build, you can install it either using pip or pipx:

```
pip install -e .
```

or

```
pipx install .
```

If you are using flakes to manage your NixOS installation, you can add the provided flake to your
inputs:

```nix
{
  description = "Configuration";

  inputs = {
    ...
    git_alert = {
      url = "github:nomisreual/git_alert";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    ...
  };
  outputs = {
    self,
    nixpkgs,
    ...
  } @ inputs: {
    # your configuration
  };
}
```

You can then add `git_alert` to your packages (don't forget to add `inputs` to the respective module):

```nix
# configuration.nix
{
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    ...

    inputs.git_alert.packages."x86_64-linux".default
    ...
  ];
}
# home.nix
{
  home.packages = with pkgs; [
    ...

    inputs.git_alert.packages."x86_64-linux".default
    ...
  ];
}
```

After rebuilding, you have git_alert at your fingertips and it gets updated whenever you update your flake.

## Usage:

You can use _git_alert_ by either calling it as a module (`python -m git_alert`) or by directly using the installed package:

```
usage: git_alert [-h] [--path PATH] [--only_dirty]

options:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  --path PATH   top level directory to start the search in
  --only_dirty  only show dirty repositories in the final report
```

## Development:

The tool is aimed to be improved and extended going forward. If you have any ideas or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

## Goals:

- [ ] more detailed checks (currently it distinguishes only between a repository being clean or not)
- [ ] speed up the lookup process
- [ ] enable caching found repositories for faster checking after the first run (maybe utilizing a database)
- [ ] GUI interface

## Contributing:

This project is under active development, so any contributions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

In case you want to submit a pull request, please:

- make sure to run the tests before submission
- use black for code formatting

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality, so feel free to use them as well.
